**Task 1.3P: Portfolio Website**

This repository contains the source code for a personal portfolio website. This portfolio website showcases the skills and projects of the developer, providing a glimpse into their work and experience.

**Usage:**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. If you haven't already installed Vue Router, run the following command to install it:

   ```
   npm install vue-router
   ```

   Note: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

4. If necessary, install Vue CLI globally:

   ```
   npm install -g @vue/cli
   ```

   This step may be required if you don't have Vue CLI already installed.

5. Because the `node_modules` folder has been excluded from this repository due to GitHub's file upload limit, you will need to reinstall project dependencies. Run the following command to do so:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

6. Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

   ```
   npm run serve
   ```

7. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address (usually http://localhost:8080/).

The portfolio website should now be up and running locally on your machine. You can access the different sections of the website, including Home, About Me, Skills, and Contact, by clicking on the corresponding links in the navigation bar.
